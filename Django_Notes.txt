1.To check django install or not -->command prompt :python -m django --version

2.To install-->pip install django

3.To get all list of core commands in django--> django-admin

4.To create project --> django-admin startproject "ProjectName"(change directory where u want to save project folder 
   and type this command,it will create inside that folder)

5.To add an App to Project -->python manage.py startapp "appname"(once app got created ,don't forget to add it on settings.py)

6.Starting the Server--> python manage.py runserver

7.Creating Migrations--->python manage.py makemigrations

8.Migrate the Database -->python manage.py migrate 

9.Creating a Super User for the Admin Panel -->python manage.py createsuperuser

10.To Collect Static Files Into One Folder--> python manage.py collectstatic

11.Routing flow -->Project URL(urls.py) --> app views(views.py) -->templates(home.html)


##Notes :To integrate code in  Version Control Git follow below steps:

1>go to project folder in command prompt by 
      -->cd project path
2>then type 
      -->git init 
  now git has been initialised in that folder 
3>to check folder in particular path we used command 
   --->dir
But here by using dir we will not be able to see the hidden folder as git
is a hidden folder

4>So to check hidden folder ,
  --->dir /ah
5>So now we have to provide git name and email , so whenever we commit the
  the code then git will show us particular name and email associated with
   the change .
   --->to do that , just do google ,git add name and email,then we 
       will get first time setup instruction in git website .follow 
       the instructions.
 
6> So add new name and email type below command with your name and email.
  -->git config --global user.name "Noor Developer"
  -->git config --global user.email creativenoor04@gmail.com

7>To check Status about commited files ,pending files etc 
  --> git status 

8>now we can add untracked files in git or can staged files using below command 
  --> git add -A (this command use to add or stage all files)
  --> git add filepath(this command use to add or stage particular files only)
it will add all untracked files in git repository.

9>Now all files are staged i.e files are available for commit .So staged files are those which
  we can commit .

10> To Commit staged files :
    -->git commit -m "Our first commit! "
So here in this command -m represent message we want to show after commit 
and note :if we include exclamation mark in message inside double quote ,then keep space 
          inside double quote before ending sentence.

11>if we have made some changes on git and wants to remove all changes before stage or commit ,
    --> git stash
so this command will remove all changes which we have done after previous commit.
So code will be as it was after last commit .

12>To see all the details regarding commit :
  --> git log

13>In git log  we will have commit after and previous with some alphaNumeric text

   So just type below command to get back to before commit stage
   --->git checkout alphaNumeric text 

  After this we can comeback to original state before commit
14>if we want to go back again after commit then do again 
   --->git checkout alphaNumeric text (this alphanumeric after commit i.e combine with head text)

15>To add code into Github ,create new repository in github and copy the url 

-->git remote add origin https://github.com/coderNoor/password_generator.git(this url generated after creating new repository i.e password_generator)
-->git branch -M main
-->git push -u origin main

After this three line code will get push to github web repository.

16>So now as our code in github , if we change something and update in github we have to following steps
  -->git status
  -->git add particular file path and file name or all git add -A
  -->git commit -m "Commited message"
  -->git push (So always after commit we have to do git push so that
     all code get updated in GitHub.

17>To get latest code on our local machine from github ,
   -->git pull(git pull will update all changes code by anyone one github after latest by anyone )

18>Branch in GitHub
   --> Earlier we have 'Master' as default branch but now Github 
       has changed it from 'Master' to 'Main'.
 

Note :while creating templates following points need to be consider :
a] Create templates folder inside the app and name of folder should be exactly "templates".
b] Inside templates folder ,create one more folder which name should be matched with appname .
c] Inside templates folder inside appname folder create files with '.html' extension	,
    for example: home.html .
d] Inside that Html files we can write all html code .
e] <form action="{% url 'newpassword' %}">  used to pass url name in html ,here newpassword is name of url which we have mention in url.py
f]<a></a> this anchor tab used to refer url i.e href so that we can go back to home page or to redirect into any url 
   example :<a href="{% url 'home' %}">Go Back To Home Page</a>
12.To pass parameters from views , in redering function add parameter like Dictionary ,
    for example :
     def home(request): 
         return render(request,'generator/home.html',{'password':'ash2762@#$%12'})

    -->This above function is present in app view .from this function we are passing paaword to html page .
    -->To get that password value from html code ,just pass the key in HTml code inside two curly braces {{ password }} and 
        there should be gap in side curly braces as in example i have written password in midle of curly brace .
        So that home page will have password value when we render the page in browser. 

13.then in url.py in project level , pass the path.
   example :
           path('',views.home)
   
   note:import the app views in url.py.
        example: from generator import views 
              where as 'generator' is  app name 

14.we can use git for paticular project by passing below command in that project path:
              Command-->git init
15.As git will not appear in command prompt as we pass 'dir' command to get all files in that particular as git is hidden.
   So to check hidden files in folder use command -->dir /ah
16.Difference in Git and GitHub.
    -->git is version control tool which helps to keep track our code .
    -->Where as Github is a website where we can upload our code as repository which we can get anytime after browsing.
    -->We do not need GitHub to use Git .
