1.To check django install or not -->command prompt :python -m django --version

2.To install-->pip install django

3.To get all list of core commands in django--> django-admin

4.To create project --> django-admin startproject "ProjectName"(change directory where u want to save project folder 
   and type this command,it will create inside that folder)

5.To add an App to Project -->python manage.py startapp "appname"(once app got created ,don't forget to add it on settings.py)

6.Starting the Server--> python manage.py runserver

7.Creating Migrations--->python manage.py makemigrations

8.Migrate the Database -->python manage.py migrate 

9.Creating a Super User for the Admin Panel -->python manage.py createsuperuser

10.To Collect Static Files Into One Folder--> python manage.py collectstatic

11.Routing flow -->Project URL(urls.py) --> app views(views.py) -->templates(home.html)

Note :while creating templates following points need to be consider :
a] Create templates folder inside the app and name of folder should be exactly "templates".
b] Inside templates folder ,create one more folder which name should be matched with appname .
c] Inside templates folder inside appname folder create files with '.html' extension	,
    for example: home.html .
d] Inside that Html files we can write all html code .
e] <form action="{% url 'newpassword' %}">  used to pass url name in html ,here newpassword is name of url which we have mention in url.py
f]<a></a> this anchor tab used to refer url i.e href so that we can go back to home page or to redirect into any url 
   example :<a href="{% url 'home' %}">Go Back To Home Page</a>
12.To pass parameters from views , in redering function add parameter like Dictionary ,
    for example :
     def home(request): 
         return render(request,'generator/home.html',{'password':'ash2762@#$%12'})

    -->This above function is present in app view .from this function we are passing paaword to html page .
    -->To get that password value from html code ,just pass the key in HTml code inside two curly braces {{ password }} and 
        there should be gap in side curly braces as in example i have written password in midle of curly brace .
        So that home page will have password value when we render the page in browser. 

13.then in url.py in project level , pass the path.
   example :
           path('',views.home)
   
   note:import the app views in url.py.
        example: from generator import views 
              where as 'generator' is  app name 


##Notes :To integrate code in  Version Control Git follow below steps:

1>go to project folder in command prompt by 
      -->cd project path
2>then type 
      -->git init 
  now git has been initialised in that folder 
3>to check folder in particular path we used command 
   --->dir
But here by using dir we will not be able to see the hidden folder as git
is a hidden folder

4>So to check hidden folder ,
  --->dir /ah
5>So now we have to provide git name and email , so whenever we commit the
  the code then git will show us particular name and email associated with
   the change .
   --->to do that , just do google ,git add name and email,then we 
       will get first time setup instruction in git website .follow 
       the instructions.
 
6> So add new name and email type below command with your name and email.
  -->git config --global user.name "Noor Developer"
  -->git config --global user.email creativenoor04@gmail.com

7>To check Status about commited files ,pending files etc 
  --> git status 

8>now we can add untracked files in git or can staged files using below command 
  --> git add -A (this command use to add or stage all files)
  --> git add filepath(this command use to add or stage particular files only)
it will add all untracked files in git repository.

9>Now all files are staged i.e files are available for commit .So staged files are those which
  we can commit .

10> To Commit staged files :
    -->git commit -m "Our first commit! "
So here in this command -m represent message we want to show after commit 
and note :if we include exclamation mark in message inside double quote ,then keep space 
          inside double quote before ending sentence.

11>if we have made some changes on git and wants to remove all changes before stage or commit ,
    --> git stash
so this command will remove all changes which we have done after previous commit.
So code will be as it was after last commit .

12>To see all the details regarding commit :
  --> git log

13>In git log  we will have commit after and previous with some alphaNumeric text

   So just type below command to get back to before commit stage
   --->git checkout alphaNumeric text 

  After this we can comeback to original state before commit
14>if we want to go back again after commit then do again 
   --->git checkout alphaNumeric text (this alphanumeric after commit i.e combine with head text)

15>To add code into Github ,create new repository in github and copy the url 

-->git remote add origin https://github.com/coderNoor/password_generator.git(this url generated after creating new repository i.e password_generator)
-->git branch -M main
-->git push -u origin main

After this three line code will get push to github web repository.

16>So now as our code in github , if we change something and update in github we have to following steps
  -->git status
  -->git add particular file path and file name or all git add -A
  -->git commit -m "Commited message"
  -->git push (So always after commit we have to do git push so that
     all code get updated in GitHub.

17>To get latest code on our local machine from github ,
   -->git pull(git pull will update all changes code by anyone one github after latest by anyone )

18>Branch in GitHub
   --> Earlier we have 'Master' as default branch but now Github 
       has changed it from 'Master' to 'Main'.
   --> Main is default branch now.
   -->The importance of branch is 'Main' will act as a Admin who have full control to push pull commit changes directly but if we have sub branch 
      then Main or Master have can pull requests or delete request that were made my branch .So Branch helps us to control the changes and once verifying 
      changes only main/master can accept changes .
   -->To check branch :
         -->git branch
            this command will show all the branch we are using for that repository.
   -->To add new branch in repository :
         -->git branch BranchName
            Here BranchName we can give any name as per our choice .
   -->By default , we are in main branch but to get switch into new branch :
         -->git branch checkout BranchName
   -->Now do all staged in this path i.e add all changes in branch,commit all changes in branch ,do git push in same path(git add , git commit -m "message related to commit",git push) .
      Then when we refresh in gitHub Repository ,there new branch get created with pull request .Then we can send this pull
      request to other team members to review ,then if everthing ok then team lead/team member will approve to merge pull request .
      
      So once we do merge pull Request ,then this changes will get updated in Main/Master in repositories then we can delete the Branch.
      we can delete branch because it purpose for review before pull done .

   -->So for if we are working in big Project with large team ,its always better to create branch then add ,commit ,push and in git hub create pull request
      which can be reviewed by the senior developer and after reviewing if all good then Merge Pull request into Main .And then Remove the Branch
  

19.Difference in Git and GitHub.
    -->git is version control tool which helps to keep track our code .
    -->Where as Github is a website where we can upload our code as repository which we can get anytime after browsing.
    -->We do not need GitHub to use Git .


#Models in Django Application

1.Models are used to connect code and Database together i.e here models are the interface that has functionality to perform database task in python envoronment.
  So Using Models we can write DB Query and connection in Django using Python code .So Basically Models used for interaction with DB .

2.To use Model , In apps which we have created has model file .We have to open it  and create the class .

3.So we can create class in model as follows :
   --> class Project(models.Model)

4.There are various db models have for DB .So Always we have to pick same field name to get connect with db .
  All Fields name can be found on django documentation:
  -->https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/fields/

5.So to define field i.e datatype for Db field , we can define in below ways:

    -->class Project(models.Model):
          title = models.CharField()
    Here , After models. we can define any datatype which we need as per fields in Django which we want to mapped with our variable .
    So Here we defining tittle variable as character field in db .So django has specific name to define its datatype to mapped in Db .
    So Here Charfield is  defined as character datatype and inside parenthesis we can define max length of that character  . 
    For example here , 
        
    -->title = models.CharField(max_length = 100)

   So like Length other datatype may have more customize properties which can be defined inside parenthesis .So that things we can checkout
   from  django documentation models fields link.
6.If we want to make some field to accept  Null Value then in bracket we have to pass 'blank =True'

    -->url = models.URLField(blank = True)
     So here as we have passed blank true means we are accepting null value for that column . by default columns are blank = false i.e not null
     So for those case if value are empty will cause error ,So to avoid error always passed blank = True if column ar not mandatory.
     Note: Whenever we use imageField Data Type model the we must install Pillow in python otherwise we will get error regarding missing model
7.Migration:
     --> To update any changes in code to DB ,we need to do migrations .
     To check if any migration pending:
          --->python manage.py makemigrations
     To make migrations:
          -->python manage.py migrate
     
     -->If we want to check what migration we have made or which field we have created in models then 
        for  that go to that app , inside app we have migration folder ,inside migration folder 0001_initial.py file will have all field details .
        So for our example :
              -->inside porfolio app ,inside migration folder,inside 0001_initial.py we have field related data .
8.So whatever field we have created in model ,those all fields are represented as column of table whereas
     -->TableName is ClassName in model 
         for example : here we have created a class inside model is 
                       class Project(models.Model):
         So here Project is Table Name 
     -->Similarly ColumnName will be all Fields defined in model
        for example:here we have created fields inside project class are 

                  class Project(models.Model):
                    title = models.CharField(max_length = 100)
                    description = models.CharField(max_length = 300)
                    images = models. ImageField( upload_to = 'portfolio/images/')
                    url = models.URLField(blank = True)

        So here title,description,images and url are column name in table Project in database.

10.Admin Page:
   -->To go to admin page : 
                          http://localhost:8000/admin

   -->To create username and password type command :
                                 
                         python manage.py createsuperuser

      then type the username which u want as admin ,
      then type the emailid and the type the password that u want for login to admin page .
      For Example :
                Here we have username:noorCoder

  -->If we want to change password then :
                          python manage.py changepassword username
     For Example :
              Python manage.py changepassword noorCoder
     So here noorCoder is username which admin password we want to change.
-->Now after login into Admin Page ,we can add project models inside it .
   To do that we have to go to app , inside app we have admin.py file ,
   inside that file we have to add whatever model we want to add into admin page .
   
   Inside admin.py , write following code :
       --> from .models import ClassName in model 
       So here we have import class from models which we have created .
       For Example :
            --> from .models import Project
          Here Project is class which we have created in model.

     then add that class into admin .
            -->admin.site.register(Project)
           So here we have added class Project into Admin Page .So that we can have all fields which we have created in models inside Project class.
-->So now after registering model if we go to admin page ,we can see Projects tab.
   So if we click on that we go to project page and if we click on add ,then we will be able to see all fields which we have created in that model.
   For Example : Here we have register 'Project' model which have four fields title ,description,image and url.
                 Now we can see all 4 properties in admin pages in which we can filled values and post in website.
                 here in admin page ,the properties those are in bold font are required field as we have not passed blank =True
                 Where non required field will be in normal font
